### Face-morphing -- ***Spring 2016***
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/meccaLeccaHi/face_morphing)
This was the first project that got me really hooked on the exciting possibilities in open-source programming.
Starting in grad school, I had been on the lookout for a method of morphing faces without the tedium of manually-placing hundreds of 'points' on each face.
Quite unexpectedly, I found that I was able to get really good results using image segmentation tools ([ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/), namely), which had actually been designed application to MRI images of the brain. Here was a tool that excelled at unsupervised alignment of anatomical brain scans, and we were able to use it (quite successfully) to align (and transition between) different faces. This worked really well for morphing between stationary faces in an entirely 'unsupervised' fashion (see figure below).

My main interest was in using 'life-like' clips of moving, talking faces, however. So soon after, I began a collaboration with [Supasorn Suwajanakorn](http://www.supasorn.com//), then at Washington University. He had created these really nice controllable models of a handful of different celebrities (link [here](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/3DPersona/)). With them, we were prepared to apply the same segmentation technique to each frame of a short video.

Obviously, this required a substantial increase in the computational time involved in generating our stimuli. So, at this point, we decided to enlist the help of the University of Iowa's [high-performance computing cluster](https://hpc.uiowa.edu/). Using a distributed approach, we were able to generate our images in *hours instead of days*. The results were better than I had hoped for (see figure below).

### Voice-morphing -- ***Fall 2016***
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/meccaLeccaHi/voice_morphing)
After beginning my post-doc, I also became interested in understanding how the brain represents different identities of voices, which, despite being less informative than faces, are still a hugely important cue to help us to determine a person's identity.
In order to achieve test this, we planned to take the same approach we did with faces, but needed a completely different tool to morph between voices.

Enter [Hideki Kawahara](http://www.wakayama-u.ac.jp/~kawahara/index-e.html), who was on sabbatical at Google UK at the time and had agreed to collaborate on our project.
Dr. Kawahara had determined the most important acoustic features in discriminating between voices of different identities, and had created an algorithm to projects every voice into a reduced space, based on these dimensions (link [here](http://www.wakayama-u.ac.jp/~kawahara/STRAIGHTadv/index_e.html), *awesome* demo [here](https://youtu.be/vxiOu1HwQ-k?t=16)).

The code for this tool was written in MATLAB, so we decided not to use an open-source language to generate this stimuli. For the voices themselves, I enlisted the services of several different voice-over actors through the website [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/), to impersonate the celebrity voice of my choosing (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Barack Obama, etc.). I really couldn't have been more pleased with the results (see below).

### Gaming/Eye-Tracking with Python -- ***Spring 2017***
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/meccaLeccaHi/py_stimuli)
I would have to recommend creating a video game for anyone who loves old video games and/or wants to learn Python. Fortunately for me, I'm both!

This was actually really nostalgic. I needed to make a "fun", "gamified" platform for our neuroscience studies. So, naturally, I decided to use sound effects and transitions from some of my childhood favorites, including: Punch-Out!!, Super Mario Bros., Base-Wars, and of course, GoldenEye.
This project relies heavily on [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org/), for presentation and timing and [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/) for controls (mainly). Although we initially tried this using fancy eye-tracking software, ultimately, we discovered the good ol' X-Box controller to [work flawlessly](https://github.com/FRC4564/Xbox) and be way less of a pain for participants (thanks Microsoft!). Both the patients and I had a lot of fun with this one. We even got ≈25% greater participation by the pediatric patients, which put a smile on my face :) I believe this one speaks for itself -- check it out below.

### Perceptual Studies via AWS Mechanical Turk -- ***Summer 2017***
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/meccaLeccaHi/mech_turk)

When given the choice between collecting data from college freshman one-by-one or anonymous internet users hundreds or thousands at a time, it was easy to choose the latter. Although it required a little elbow-grease (see excellent [tutorial](https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/ttt/)), the time and money required to gather data with this approach was reduced by more than 90%.

{% include figure.html url="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/22c2049faf1f36ee5e7670e43ccebeed19355db4/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4662795369754b2e706e673f31" caption="Face similarity experiment, via Amazon mTurk." width="70%" %}

In order to visualize the perceived similarity (or *dis*-similarity) of these faces using the survey data we collected, we performed a simple form of dimensionality reduction using MDS. MDS is a useful way to visualize high-dimensional distance (or “dissimilarity”) data in a few dimensions — usually only two, for ease of visualization (see below).

### Record Linkage -- ***Fall 2017***
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/meccaLeccaHi/record_linkage)
As my first major gig outside of academia, I spent a lot of time surveying the literature for this one, and I learned a *lot* as a result. RL turned out to be a great area for me to work in as it A) has rich history and methodology going back as long people have been trying to keep track of each other (genealogy, censuses, etc.). Consequently, there is a rich literature dedicated to the topic, including both well-established probabilistic approaches and more modern modern approaches using single- and multi-layer neural networks. RL also has a few characteristic issues that routinely require attention including:
- substantial class imbalances (number of non-matches *far* exceeds the number of matches)
- There's a *huge* number of potential Cartesian pairs, so we maximize pairing with the [Kuhn-Munkres](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/munkres/) (i.e. Hungarian) Algorithm.
- Research with HIPAA-protected data requires patient de-identification, making matching more challenging.
In our case, we trained neural networks to match records across multiple SQL databases using ’fuzzy’ matching, resulting in a ≈75% reduction in non-matched records. As a result, we were able to improve the accuracy of a medical record linkage system providing clinical performance metrics to more than 200 hospitals.
