Hi! I'm a 26-year-old aspiring data scientist currently based in Chicago. I recently completed a masters degree in electrical & computer engineering and am exploring my options for a career in data science and machine learning.

I enjoy using data science techniques to pursue fascinating but as-yet unexplored questions, such as, *are country artists who sing about trucks more likely to also [sing about beer?](/trucks-and-beer/)* Or, *are male Sharks [more likely to make deals](/shark-tank-analysis/) with men than women?* I've enjoyed a fair bit of success on the [*Data Is Beautiful*](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/search?sort=top&q=author%3A%22textureflow%22+title%3A%5BOC%5D&restrict_sr=on) subreddit while pursuing answers to questions like these. I also maintain an active [GitHub](http://github.com/johnwmillr) profile, where I've enjoyed collaborating with various contributors on a number of my personal projects.

I earned my masters degree from the [University of Iowa](https://ece.engineering.uiowa.edu/), where I helped develop automated diagnostics for diseases of the retina. Before heading to grad school, I served as a research assistant in the [Human Spinal Cord Research Lab](https://www.healthcare.uiowa.edu/labs/hscrl-neurosurgery/) in Iowa's Department of Neurosurgery. I previously graduated from [Goshen College](https://www.goshen.edu/), where I completed a B.A. in physics with a minor in English, and remained actively involved in music.

Currently applying to data scientist positions, I look forward to joining a company that shares my enthusiasm for wrangling unruly datasets and challenges me to grow as a thoughtful communicator and engineer.

I'd love to chat about data science, open source project ideas, or why *The Great British Baking Show* is the best TV being made today. Feel free to reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnwmillr) or [email](mailto:john.w.millr@gmail.com).
