Well, here it is -- a post.

The world of web design is completely new to me. So far it's been fun! Although installing dependencies for Jekyll and Ruby was actually kind of annoying... But I think I've got it figured out now! Anyway, given my limited design capabilities, these posts will be a bit of a learning process for me.

Check out the [Vulfpeck](http://vulfpeck.com/) *Holy Trinities* [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsooA4Bro40) that dropped today. It's an instant classic.
