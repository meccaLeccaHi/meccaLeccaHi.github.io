It would certainly seem that self-driving cars are soon going to [change life as we know it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielaraya/2019/01/10/top-10-industries-transformed-by-self-driving-cars/#35cd552759ae). As such, it feels like self-driving cars are a topic resting on the very cutting-edge of technology. While it's true that amazing developments in this arena continue to take place regularly (in part due to the [investments](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/01/15/ford-vw-partnering-on-trucks-and-maybe-electric-and-self-driving-vehicles/#6bd17fc56265) being made my a growing number of auto manufacturers), many people might be surprised to find that there was a self-driving at Carnegie Mellon back when this author was still in grade school -- 1989. That's right. Like most major technologies to sweep into our lives, the Army did it first.

The video is really quite interesting for several reasons:
- Not only does the tech in the video seem to do a decent job at driving, but the hardware it relies on is from over two decades ago. I mean, c'mon -- 3.5" floppy disks were just starting to catch on!
- It actually gives you quite a lot of techical explanation regarding the inner machinations of ALVINN's 'mind'. I felt like it gave me better insight into the AI behind self-driving cars.

**Check it out!** It's well worth the watch!
