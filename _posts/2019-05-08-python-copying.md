description: Demo on copying objects in Python.
---

I've been reading a great book that was recently gifted to me- [Math Adventures with Python](https://nostarch.com/mathadventures) by Peter Farrell. It contains a lot of fun exercises that convey rather technical mathematical concepts via relatively simple Python code. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Among the subtler points made, is the following example, which I wanted to make available to my students. What follows is a brief demo on how to avoid getting "caught" by one of Python's more unique quirks - **_'shallow'_ vs. _'deep'_ copying of Python objects.**

---

As we can see below, Python objects exhibit some strange behaviors when duplicating existing variables.
- Let's declare a list variable and then set another variable to equal the first one.


```python
a = [1,2,3] # declare a list
b = a # set another variable equal to it
print(b)
```

    [1, 2, 3]


Then, let's change the value of the first variable.
- The second variable should be unaffected, _right?_


```python
a.append(4)
print(a)
print(b)
```

    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    [1, 2, 3, 4]


**Apparently not!**
As we can see above, by changing `a`, we unknowingly changed `b`, as well.
- This is because `a` and `b` are just names for the same object in your computer's memory.
- We are basically telling Python: "Assign this list to variables `a` and `b`".
> Like how 'William' and 'Bill' can refer to the same person.

Several solutions exist to this problem. One way to make sure that each variable is an entirely separate object, is to use **index notation**.
- We've seen how to use _indexing_ to slice arrays (e.g. `foo[4:10:2]`).
- We'll use the same notation to effectively tell Python: "Assign all the contents of list `a` to the variable `b`".


```python
a = [1,2,3]
b = a[::]
print(b)
a.append(4)
print(a)
print(b)
```

    [1, 2, 3]
    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    [1, 2, 3]


As we can see, the variables are no longer linked to each other.

**Just remember:** You can use index notation any time you want to avoid the object reference problem we saw here.

---

**DataFrames**, on the other hand, are handled _a bit differently_ when it comes to copying.

The same problem applies to DataFrame objects, as well -- we need to take precautions to not modify the source DataFrame. But, the solution is different.
- Instead of indexing, we use the `copy()` method to duplicate a DataFrame.
- Although, often it ends up being unnecessary, when performing interactive data exploration, it's better to be safe than sorry.


```python
# Python throws up a warning up when we try to operate on a shallow copy (to remind us of our misdeeds).
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1,2]}) # create DataFrame
df_sub = df[0:1] # subset DataFrame
df_sub.x = -1 # manipulate subset
```

    /anaconda3/envs/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pandas/core/generic.py:4405: SettingWithCopyWarning: 
    A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.
    Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead
    
    See the caveats in the documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#indexing-view-versus-copy
      self[name] = value



```python
# The solution is simply to perform a deep copy, making them separate objects in the computer's memory.
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1,2]})
df_sub_copy = df[0:1].copy()
df_sub_copy.x = -1
print(df)
# No more warnings :)
```

       x
    0  1
    1  2
