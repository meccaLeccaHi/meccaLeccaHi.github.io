When Jerry isn't [dodging yeti's](https://ski.ihoc.net/), he loves tearing up the slopes! This is a simple app that allows Jerry to keep track of his experiences at different ski resorts, and find new ones based on his location input! This is a beginner-friendly example of a simple [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application, that uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) as the CSS framework and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as the database. It's designed to help demonstrate the use of Flask, within the context of an introductory Python course. As such, the code in this repo is deliberately simplified and heavily-commented for clarity.

>This project was inspired by numerous sources, most notably: 
>- [*New and Improved Flask Mega-Tutorial*](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) by *Miguel Grinberg* (Highly recommended)

>Dependencies: Numpy, Scipy, [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), and [Googlemaps](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python).

>To run, execute the following commands:
```
$ sudo apt-get -y install python3 python3-venv python3-dev  
$ git clone https://github.com/meccaLeccaHi/snowblog  
$ cd snowblog  
$ python3 -m venv venv  
$ source venv/bin/activate  
(venv)$ export FLASK_APP=microblog.py  
(venv)$ export GOOGLE_KEY='API_KEY_HERE'  
(venv)$ pip install flask-bootstrap flask-migrate flask-sqlalchemy flask-wtf numpy scipy googlemaps  
(venv)$ flask run
```

This project served as a nice opportunity to get more familiar with Flask, with the intent of eventually building an app of greater utility down the road (perhaps integrating [Plotly](https://plot.ly/products/dash/)). For now let's learning about the essential components involved with Flask. But first, a brief primer on virtual environments and environmental variables.

## Setting up the environment

Obviously, we are going to use Python 3 in this post as we have for all the others. So, if it's not installed, we can change that like so:  
`$ sudo apt-get -y install python3 python3-venv python3-dev`

### Virtual environments
A _virtual environment_ is an enclosed copy of the Python interpreter. By that I mean that when you install Python packages in a virtual environment (as opposed to the system-wide Python interpreter), only the virtual environment is affected. This provides us greater freedom to experiment with numerous environments in parallel, while keeping the changes in each separate from the others.
- This also allows others to re-create your environment more easily, as we'll see below.
- Plus, they are 'owned' by the user who creates them, so they don't require a separate admin account.

#### Create environment
We can start by creating a virtual environment inside the project we are working on. So, from within that directory, run:  
>`$ python -m venv venv`\*  
>\*If we want to use a different interpreter (e.g. `python3` or `python2`), use that instead.

This command asks Python to run the `venv` package, and creates a virtual environment named `venv` (feel free to change it as you wish). 

Did you notice that a folder named `/venv` has now been created inside your project folder? 
Now that the environmet has been created, we install it like so:
>`$ virtualenv venv`


#### Activate environment
Having done so, we can `cd` into this package and 'activate' the appropriate virtual environment whenever we want like so:
>`$ source venv/bin/activate`   

Notice that the cursor will change from `$` to `(venv) $`

#### Install environment
Now, we're ready to start customizing our environment!
**Just remember**, the changes you make inside your virtual environment are unique to that environment, and will not exist if the environment is deactivated. The changes you make *are* persistent, however, and will stay the way they are left on the last time they are used.

#### Bonus: Enumerating packages with 'requirements.txt'
When installing software, and Python packages in particular, it's not un-common to end up with a lot of libraries installed.
We can get a quick, comprehensive list of what packages we are using at any time with the commands below:  
`$ pip freeze > requirements.txt`  

This directs the output of `pip freeze`, which lists all of the current Python package dependencies, to a text file named 'requirements.txt'. Open it up and take a look. 
The beauty of it is that it allows someone else to immediately adopt the same environment by running:  
>`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Setting environmental variables
'Environmental variables' are one way for a particular environment to keep track of certain settings, and to pass thos settings between different processes within the same environment. They are usually employed to keep track of ephemeral data, such as location of the current working directory.

By convention, environmental variables are typically defined using all capital letters, which helps users distinguish environmental variables from other variable types.

As with most variables, variable assignment consists of relating a key to a value, in most instances a string, using the following format:  
`KEY="value with spaces"`

For example:export TEST_VAR
```
$ BASH=bin/bash
$ echo $BASH
bin/bash
```

#### Creating environmental variables
The variable `BASH` now exists within this current  environment, but will be destroyed as soon as this instance of the shell interpreter is closed. To make these variables persist, we use `export`, like so:  
`export BASH`
Our program will use two environmental variables. `FLASK_APP` and `GOOGLE_KEY`.
- `FLASK_APP` tells Flask how to import our application:  
`(venv) $ export FLASK_APP=microblog.py`
- `GOOGLE_KEY` provides the necessary API key for [googlemaps](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python)  
`(venv)$ export GOOGLE_KEY='API_KEY_HERE'`

One last thing to mention is that we can, if we desire, include the creation of these variables during login by adding the `export` commands to our `~/.bashrc` file (at the bottom is fine).


## Templates
Templates, as employed by Flask, are loosely analagous to a Python function, in that they are reusable sets of operations that accept pre-defined inputs and transform those inputs to produce a pre-defined output. In this case the inputs are the data required by different components of a webpage, and the output is the HTML webpage.  
This allows us to separate the 'back-end' data generation elements that determine the page's functionality, from the 'front-end' layout and presentation elements that determine the page's appearance.
In Flask, templates are stored as separate files inside a */templates* folder inside the application package. An example is shown in `index.html` below.  
```
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Welcome to Snowblog</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>{{ user }}'s snowblog</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```
This is a super simple HTML page that defines the title and a heading. But, notice the place holder for user's name in the heading? That's the adaptive component defined by whatever input is provided to the template. So when I the following:
`render_template('index.html', user='Jerry')`
... an HTML page is *rendered* like so:  
{% include figure.html url="/assets/images/flask_app/render_example.png" caption="Super simple HTML page produced from our `index.html` template." width="40%" %}
