# Why is Visualization Important?

### Learning Objectives
- Describe why data visualization is important.
- Identify the characteristics of a great data visualization.

### Question: *Why Use Data Visualization?*

Today, I thought it would be useful to discuss some of the ways data visualization is useful, and why it's important.

### Why Use Data Visualization?

Because of the way the human brain processes information, charts or graphs that visualize large amounts of complex data are easier to understand than spreadsheets or reports. 

- Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner â€” and you can experiment with different scenarios by making slight adjustments.

#### Challenger Shuttle Disaster: A Case Study

Although *Edward Tufte* made great contributions to our understanding of the visual communication of information, through numerous books and articles, his most famous contribution was his critique of the handling of the **1986 Challenger Shuttle disaster**.

{% include figure_link.html url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/STS-51-L_-_Space_Shuttle_Challenger_on_the_Crawler-Transporter.jpg/220px-STS-51-L_-_Space_Shuttle_Challenger_on_the_Crawler-Transporter.jpg" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger" caption="Challenger en route to the launch site. Image source: wikipedia.com" width="30%" %}

In his critique, he highlights the poor representation of data by NASA scientists and engineers in the days leading up to the deaths of all seven crew members. We can see an example of the representations used below:

{% include figure.html url="https://project-orion-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/content_picture/2927/o_ring_rockets.jpg" caption="O-ring performance data arranged by launch date." width="50%" %}

> **After thorough inspection** of the figure above, it would seem NASA engineers had collected data indicating that ***rubber O-rings failed to seal correctly in cold weather.***
> - *Alas,* these charts were unable to sufficiently convey the danger of a liftoff in the colder-than-average weather that morning. 
> - *e.g.* Vertical typing is hard to read, the rocket cartoons obscure information...

*Most importantly,* had the data on O-ring performance been arranged by the most critical factor, temperature, instead of by launch date, decision makers would have had a much better chance of seeing that the launch, proposed to occur in weather below 66 degrees, would very likely lead to O-ring failure (see below).

{% include figure.html url="https://project-orion-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/content_picture/2928/VEp45_ring_damage2.jpg" caption="O-ring performance data arranged by temperature." width="50%" %}

Instead, as we all know, the launch proceeded when the temperature was 36 degrees, and the shuttle exploded 73 seconds after liftoff.
