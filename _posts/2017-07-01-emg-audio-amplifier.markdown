description: EMG audio amplifier I built
---

I recently published [my 5<sup>th</sup> post](http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Muscle-Audio-Amplifier-Electromyography/) on [Instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/). The Instructable walks through how to build an EMG audio amplifier. Check it out!

A couple days after posting my Instructable, I found out it had been [featured on the HackADay blog](https://hackaday.com/2017/06/24/listen-to-your-body/)! They even sent the article out to their 114K followers on Twitter. Not bad!

From their article:
> This isnâ€™t the first EMG rig weâ€™ve seen, but John does a nice job of explaining why such a special amplifier is used and how it works. He also provides a lot of pointers to more detailed information, including a paper that covers the safety aspects of hooking yourself â€” or anyone â€” up to electronics.

How kind of them! :smiley:
